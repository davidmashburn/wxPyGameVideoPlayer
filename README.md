Just a really simple video player that uses OpenCV, wxPython, and PyGame

Uses OpenCV to load frames from the video file

Uses PyGame (in a non-blocking thread) to acheive fast frame rendering and matplotlib for plotting metrics

A separate wxPython window handles the GUI events

This is forked from a previous project, ca. 4/2007
